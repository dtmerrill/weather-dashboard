# quick-check weather on the run = weather dash (we don't have time for caps)


# Why, What and How is it? (Okay - maybe SOME caps.)


## Why?
As we have discussed in the past (see my other repos' ReadMe docs), life moves fast. We don't have time to wade through the barrage of information out there. We want things simple, easy and in as few clicks as possible.

Welcome to weather dash - so you know what's happening with the weather where you want to know it - Quickly.


## What?
This straightforward weather-retrieval app takes openweather api information and presents it to you in a streamlined and clean interface. Limited interaction lets you focus only on what's needed - your current (or, past-searched) city for a current perspective on life - including a UV index reading to help you prepare.


## How?
The little things matter. We show only your past 13 cities (we're not superstitious) so they all can fit on your laptop screen. We picked a font that makes caps/non-caps moot. We highlighted the UV Index data if it is too high (5 or more is too high and everywhere is too high so far this year). We grabbed the appropriate icons to speed your perception of the information. If the screen is too busy, you can make it neater by hitting the clear button to remove the saved cities.


## What else do I need to know?
Not a bunch. I originally was using Bulma for the .css framework but found it a bit more challenging than I wanted to lay out according to project requirements.

Here's the look and feel:
